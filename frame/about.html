    <p>Frames are an older web design technique and may not be compatible with all modern browsers.The
        <strong>frame</strong> tag was used in HTML 4 to define one particular window (frame) within a
        <strong>frameset</strong>.

        It may
        be
        worth considering alternative layouts, such as using CSS to create a responsive layout that
        adjusts
        to
        different screen sizes.
